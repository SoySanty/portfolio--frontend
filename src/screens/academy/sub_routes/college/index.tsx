      <p>
        I am currently one year away from finishing my Systems Engineering
        degree, during 2020 - 2021 I froze my university studies due to the
        pandemic to get a job to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that reason, I look for a company that agrees that I can continue
        studying while I work.
